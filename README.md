# AQA-Assembler
An assembler interpreter written in C++ for AQA assembler (similar to ARM). The aim of this project is to provide a simple interpretation of the language for A level students looking to practise using the assembly language used in AQA Computer Science.

To use the assembler, specify the file path for the assembly code, and run the program. The eventual aim for the project is to mount it behind an Electron interface to allow users to write their code and test it in the same place.
